{"version" : 12.2, "message" : "Because the game is short and lacks challenge, it now runs 10 times slower to give a sense of pride and accomplishment on reaching new things.\nIf you don't like pride nor accomplishment you can import SHAME ON ME to disable this magnificent change.\nFurthermore, if you want to undo the shame you have put on yourself and re-enable this wonderful change, or want the change to be amplified even further, import WAITING IS FUN.\nAlso due to the fact that this gives the game more than enough playtime I will quit working on the update."}
